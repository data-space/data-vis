# Data modeling and visualization in R  

**Introduce_Cleansing_Techniques:**   
This tutorial compares two main packages *tidyr, reshape2* which have equivalent fuctions for data cleansing, tidying and aggregation - these are important and most of the time prerequisite steps for data exploration, visualization and modeling. 

**Introduce_Visualization_Techniques:**   
supplement the visualization tutorial in Data Science class at Bentley University. This tutorial focuses on *ggplot2* while also incorporatates other visualization packages *ggrepel, ggmap*  

**Explore_Economist_dataset:**   
The dataset (Economist.csv) consists of countries scored on how corrupt their public sectors are seen to be (Corruption Perceptions Index - CPI) and on achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living (Human Development Index - HDI). Using *ggplot2 and ggrepel*, this tutorial provides scatterplots and boxplots on country and regional levels.

**Explore_United_Nation_Voting_dataset:**   
Erik Voeten "Data and Analyses of Voting in the UN General Assembly" Routledge Handbook of International Organization, edited by Bob Reinalda (published May 27, 2013) provides information on the voting history of the United Nations General Assembly from 1946 to 2014 with specific resolutions and what decision each country made (yes/no/abstain). Data visualization showcases interesting perspectives for voting patterns and how different or similiar countries are when it comes to world concerns.
